Universal Repository Learner
==================================================

__Introduction__

This project is part of an ongoing research and written as a draft titled __Universal Repository Learner__.

Abstract:

We propose Universal Repository Learner, a method to transfer the knowledge from source tasks to a target task. It utilizes an autoencoder to extract a latent representation in a common repository, then learns a task-specific decoder on top of the latent representation using only the labeled examples of the target task.

The two key contributions of this work are: 1) We propose a new knowledge transfer method, utilizing an autoencoder to learn a common latent representation from source data, called Universal Repository Learner (URL). 2) We demonstrate the effectiveness of URL on transferring knowledge between tasks that share a similar input data modality, as well as tasks that have different input data modalities.
to improve target task learning.
